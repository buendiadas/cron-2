## About

* The project lets the developer divide the time in epochs on Ethereum Smart Contracts. 

* Every clock has its own contract and address, all of them follow the same interface.

* Clocks are automatically generated via a Crontab syntax, creating a new contract for each Crontab pattern.


## Motivation

Decoupling the scheduling logic from the Smart Contract developer has the following benefits:

 * **Interoperability**: By decoupling the scheduling logic, Smart Contracts and external services (oracles) can easily sync their clocks.
 * **Programability**: Most Smart Contracts develop their own arithmetic rules every time they want to schedule periodic changes. The complexity of coding an arbitrarily complex rule may prevent the developer to include it
 * **Security**: Relaying all programable logic to a single trusted source.

## Using it

#### 1. Install

Download the last state of `solidity-cron`

```bash
npm init -y
npm i -E solidity-cron
```

#### 2. Deploying a new cron

Every cron deployed must include the `ICron.sol` interface. 

While a crontab generator is WIP, you can deploy one of the Smart Contracts provided at [./contracts/calendar](https://github.com/carlos-buendia/solidity-cron/tree/develop/contracts/calendar)


#### 3. Use it

```javascript
import "solidity-cron/contracts/ICron.sol";

address monthly =  0x1234567891011;
Cron c = ICron(monthly)
uint256 height =  c.height();
```


## Testing

You can always use the truffle package to test and contribute to the library. The package needs from a running Ethereum rpc instance in `localhost`, port `8545`. You can run a [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) instance or run [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). You can run the tests by just running:

```bash
truffle test
```


## Contributing

The project is open to contributions, just open a PR! We follow Angular [Git Commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines), to follow `semantic-release`versioning.
